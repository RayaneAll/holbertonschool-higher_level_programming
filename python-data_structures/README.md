# Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples

![Project Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Project-98.19%25-success)

This project is part of the **[C#25] Foundations v2 - Part 2** curriculum and explores **data structures in Python**, specifically lists and tuples. You will learn how to efficiently manipulate these structures to store and manage data collections.

## Project Description

This project introduces you to **lists** and **tuples** in Python, which are fundamental data structures for organizing and manipulating collections of data. You will learn to:
- Create and modify lists.
- Manage data with tuples.
- Understand the differences and similarities between lists and tuples.
- Use advanced features such as list comprehensions, unpacking, and the `del` statement.

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will be able to:
- Describe what a list is and how to use it.
- Explain the differences and similarities between lists and strings.
- Use common list methods (`append`, `remove`, etc.).
- Manipulate lists as stacks or queues.
- Understand and use list comprehensions.
- Describe what a tuple is, how, and when to use it.
- Explain the concept of sequences and **tuple packing** and **unpacking**.
- Use the `del` statement to remove elements.

## Prerequisites and Requirements

### Prerequisites
- Familiarity with Python basics.

### Technical Requirements
- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
- **Python Version**: Python 3.8.5.
- **Allowed Editors**: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`.
- **Code Style**: Follow **pycodestyle** (version 2.7.*).

### Constraints
- All files must be **executable**.
- Each file must start with the shebang line:  
  ```bash
  #!/usr/bin/python3
  ```
- A `README.md` file must be present in the project root.
- File length will be tested using `wc`.

## Task List

### 0. Print a list of integers
Write a function that prints all integers in a list, one per line.  
**File**: `0-print_list_integer.py`

---

### 1. Secure access to an element in a list
Write a function that retrieves an element from a list at a given index. If the index is negative or out of range, return `None`.  
**File**: `1-element_at.py`

---

### 2. Replace element
Write a function that replaces an element in a list at a specific position. If the index is invalid, the original list remains unchanged.  
**File**: `2-replace_in_list.py`

---

### 3. Print a list of integers... in reverse!
Write a function that prints all integers in a list in reverse order.  
**File**: `3-print_reversed_list_integer.py`

---

### 4. Replace in a copy
Write a function that replaces an element in a copy of a list without modifying the original list.  
**File**: `4-new_in_list.py`

---

### 5. Can you C me now?
Write a function that removes all characters `c` and `C` from a given string.  
**File**: `5-no_c.py`

---

### 6. Lists of lists = Matrix
Write a function that prints a matrix of integers. Each row of the matrix should be printed on a new line.  
**File**: `6-print_matrix_integer.py`

---

### 7. Tuples addition
Write a function that adds two tuples. If a tuple has fewer than two elements, use 0 for the missing elements.  
**File**: `7-add_tuple.py`

---

### 8. More returns!
Write a function that returns a tuple containing the length of a string and its first character. If the string is empty, the first character should be `None`.  
**File**: `8-multiple_returns.py`

---

### 9. Find the max
Write a function that finds and returns the largest integer in a list. If the list is empty, return `None`.  
**File**: `9-max_integer.py`

---

### 10. Only by 2
Write a function that returns a new list indicating if each integer in a list is divisible by 2 (`True` or `False`).  
**File**: `10-divisible_by_2.py`

---

### 11. Delete at
Write a function that deletes an element from a list at a given position. If the index is invalid, the list remains unchanged.  
**File**: `11-delete_at.py`

---

### 12. Switch
Swap the values of two variables and print them.  
**File**: `12-switch.py`
