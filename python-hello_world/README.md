## Project Description

This project introduces beginner developers to Python, a powerful and versatile programming language. You will learn how to:
- Use the Python interpreter.
- Manipulate strings, integers, floats, and more.
- Apply **PEP8** style conventions to write readable and standard-compliant code.

Each task allows you to practice a fundamental concept in Python. The project is designed to progress logically and gradually, preparing you for more advanced projects.

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will be able to:
- Use the Python interpreter.
- Print text and variables using `print`.
- Work with strings: indexing, slicing, and manipulation.
- Follow Python code style conventions with **pycodestyle**.
- Build executable Python scripts that adhere to standards.

## Prerequisites and Requirements

### Prerequisites
- A basic understanding of programming concepts is helpful but not mandatory.

### Technical Requirements
- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
- **Python Version**: Python 3.8.*
- **Allowed Editors**: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`.
- **Code Style**: Must comply with **pycodestyle** (version 2.7.*).

### Constraints

## Task List

### 0. Hello, print
**Objective**: Write a Python script that prints exactly:  
```python
"Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle"
```
**File**: `2-print.py`

---

### 1. Print integer
**Objective**: Complete the source code to display an integer followed by the string "Battery street". Use **f-strings**.  
**Example Output**:  
```
98 Battery street
```
**File**: `3-print_number.py`

---

### 2. Print float
**Objective**: Display a float with a precision of 2 decimal places without converting the variable to a string. Use **f-strings**.  
**Example Output**:  
```
Float: 3.14
```
**File**: `4-print_float.py`

---

### 3. Print string
**Objective**: Print a string 3 times, followed by its first 9 characters.  
**Example Output**:  
```
Holberton SchoolHolberton SchoolHolberton School
Holberton
```
**File**: `5-print_string.py`

---

### 4. Play with strings
**Objective**: Combine two strings to display "Welcome to Holberton School!" on a single line.  
**File**: `6-concat.py`

---

### 5. Copy - Cut - Paste
**Objective**: Manipulate a string to extract the first 3 letters, the last 2 letters, and the content without the first and last letters.  
**Example Output**:  
```
First 3 letters: Hol  
Last 2 letters: on  
Middle word: olberto
```
**File**: `7-edges.py`

---

### 6. Create a new sentence
**Objective**: Create a new sentence without adding new variables or using loops.  
**Example Output**:  
```
object-oriented programming with Python
```
**File**: `8-concat_edges.py`

---

### 7. Easter Egg
**Objective**: Write a Python script that prints ‚ÄúThe Zen of Python‚Äù by Tim Peters.  
**Example Output**:  
```
Beautiful is better than ugly.  
Explicit is better than implicit.  
...  
```
**File**: `9-easter_egg.py`
