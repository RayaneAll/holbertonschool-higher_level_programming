# Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary

![Project Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Project-96.24%25-success)

This project is part of the **[C#25] Foundations v2 - Part 2** curriculum and explores advanced Python data structures: **sets** and **dictionaries**. You will learn how to manipulate these structures for specific use cases and integrate them into your Python scripts.

## Project Description

This project deepens your Python knowledge with **sets** and **dictionaries**. You will discover:
- Methods and features associated with these structures.
- The advantages of sets and dictionaries compared to lists.
- How to use advanced functions such as `map`, `filter`, and `lambda`.
- How to solve complex problems using simple and powerful tools.

These concepts are essential for writing efficient, readable, and optimized Python code.

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will be able to:
- Explain why Python programming is powerful.
- Use sets and their most common methods.
- Differentiate between use cases for sets, lists, and dictionaries.
- Create and manipulate Python dictionaries.
- Understand and use `lambda`, `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` functions.
- Iterate through sets and dictionaries.
- Solve complex problems related to structured data.

## Prerequisites and Requirements

### Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of Python lists and tuples.
- Experience with iteration using `for` loops.

### Technical Requirements
- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
- **Python Version**: Python 3.8.5.
- **Allowed Editors**: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`.
- **Code Style**: Adhere to **pycodestyle** (version 2.7.*).

### Constraints
- All files must be **executable**.
- Each file must start with the shebang line:  
  ```bash
  #!/usr/bin/python3
  ```
- A `README.md` file must be present in the project root.
- File length will be tested using `wc`.
