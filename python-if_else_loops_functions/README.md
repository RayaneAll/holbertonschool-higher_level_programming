## Project Description

This project delves into **conditional statements**, **loops**, and **functions** in Python. It also emphasizes programming best practices and adherence to code style conventions (PEP8). The goal is to help you master these fundamental concepts necessary for progressing in software development.

You will:
- Use conditional statements like `if`, `if ... else`, and `elif`.
- Implement `for` and `while` loops to handle iterations.
- Write and use functions with well-defined variable scopes.
- Manipulate strings, numbers, and iterations using tools such as `range`, `break`, and `continue`.

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will be able to:
- Explain the importance of indentation in Python.
- Use conditional statements (`if`, `if ... else`) and comments effectively.
- Assign values to variables and understand their scope.
- Use `while` and `for` loops, as well as the `break` and `continue` statements.
- Use `else` clauses in loops.
- Understand and utilize the `pass` statement.
- Create and use functions in Python.
- Understand traceback errors and how to resolve them.
- Use basic arithmetic operators.

## Prerequisites and Requirements

### Prerequisites
- No prior programming experience is required, but a basic understanding of computer concepts is helpful.

### Technical Requirements
- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
- **Python Version**: Python 3.8.*
- **Allowed Editors**: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`.
- **Code Style**: Adherence to **pycodestyle** (version 2.7.*).

### Constraints
- All files must be **executable**.
- Each file must start with the shebang line:  
  ```bash
  #!/usr/bin/python3
  ```
- File length will be tested using `wc`.
