# Python - Import & Modules

![Project Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Project-97.59%25-success)

This project is part of the **[C#25] Foundations v2 - Part 2** curriculum and explores the concept of **modules** and **imports** in Python. You will learn to organize your code into modules, import functions and variables, use command-line arguments, and gain a deeper understanding of Pythonâ€™s inner workings.

## Project Description

The **Python - Import & Modules** project focuses on managing and organizing Python code using modules. Modules enable code reuse and efficient structuring. You will also learn to use command-line arguments and explore the contents of a module.

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will be able to:
- Understand why Python programming is powerful.
- Import functions and variables from another file.
- Create and use Python modules.
- Use the built-in `dir()` function to explore a module.
- Prevent a Python script from executing code when it is imported.
- Handle command-line arguments with `sys.argv`.

---

## Prerequisites and Requirements

### Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of Python.

### Technical Requirements
- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS.
- **Python Version**: Python 3.10.*
- **Allowed Editors**: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`.
- **Code Style**: Follow **pycodestyle** (version 2.7.*).

### Constraints
- All files must be **executable**.
- Each file must start with the shebang line:  
  ```bash
  #!/usr/bin/python3
  ```
- File length will be tested using `wc`.

## Task List

### 0. Import a simple function from a simple file
Import an `add(a, b)` function from a file and display the result of the addition.  
**File**: `0-add.py`

---

### 1. My first toolbox!
Import multiple functions from a file and perform mathematical operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.  
**File**: `1-calculation.py`

---

### 2. How to make a script dynamic!
Write a script that displays the number of command-line arguments passed and their contents.  
**File**: `2-args.py`

---

### 3. Infinite addition
Write a script that sums all command-line arguments.  
**File**: `3-infinite_add.py`

---

### 4. Who are you?
Display all names defined in a compiled module, excluding those starting with `__`.  
**File**: `4-hidden_discovery.py`

---

### 5. Everything can be imported
Import a variable from a file and display its value.  
**File**: `5-variable_load.py`
